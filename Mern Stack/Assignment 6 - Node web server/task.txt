Assignment 6 : Creating a Simple Web Server with Node.js
Objective: Build a basic web server using the Node.js http module to handle different routes and serve corresponding HTML pages.
Instructions:
Create a new Node.js project with a main file (e.g. server.js).
Use the http module to create a server.
Implement routing to serve different HTML pages based on the requested routes.
Create at least three HTML pages, each representing a different route. Or you can use the Pages you made in the Laundry Website.
Test your server by accessing different routes in a web browser.
Requirements:
The server should listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).
Implement routes for the following paths:
/home: Serve the HTML page for the home route.
/about: Serve the HTML page for the about route.
/contact: Serve the HTML page for the contact route.


Include appropriate HTTP status codes in your responses.
Use asynchronous and modular code where applicable.
Include error handling for invalid routes with a custom 404 page.
Enhance your server by:
Adding CSS styling to your HTML pages.
Handling additional routes with meaningful content.
