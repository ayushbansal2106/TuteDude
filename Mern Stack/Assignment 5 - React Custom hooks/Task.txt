Problem Statement: 
The problem statement of this assignment is to create a custom hook in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API.

Problem Description:
In this task, you will be introducing custom hooks to easy our commonly used tasks for example we generally do some fetch opetaaions to get data from backend api we will use a dummy api link to fetch data using fetch function of javascript in order to make it smoothely usable we will make a custom hook useFetch. Dummy api provided below in tips.

Requirements:
Your custom hook should be named useFetch.
The useFetch hook should accept a URL parameter.
The hook should handle fetching data from the provided URL using fetch or any other preferred method.
It should return the following values:
-data: The fetched data (if any).
-loading: A boolean indicating whether the data is still loading.
-error: Any error that occurred during the fetch process.
Your hook should handle loading states and error states
appropriately.
Utilize useState, useEffect, and useCallback hooks as necessary.
Create a simple React component that uses your useFetch hook to
fetch data from an API and display it on the screen.
Style the component as desired using CSS or any preferred styling
method.

Tips:
You can start by creating a new file for your custom hook, for
example, useFetch.js.
Test your hook with different API endpoints to ensure its flexibility
and reliability.
Consider error handling scenarios such as network errors or
malformed data.
You can use a placeholder UI or loading spinner to indicate when
data is being fetched.
Keep your component simple and focused on consuming the
useFetch hook. You can expand on it later for more complex
scenarios.
